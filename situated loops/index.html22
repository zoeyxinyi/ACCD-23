    <p style="color:rgb(255, 25, 17);">I image fragmented social media messages by 
      composing them into a single video layer, and then from the video layers, 
      a gallery is formed by layering them on top of each other.
       Then the camera shoots at the top. The hands are controlled to play by leap motion, 
       creating the entire performance mode. By looping the video gallery in the background, 
       it creates a sense of a whirlpool that is always going on. 
       It also reflects the user's state of being lost in the flood of information in 
       the current social media.  </p>
