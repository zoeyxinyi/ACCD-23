    <p style="color:rgb(255, 25, 17);">I image fragmented social media messages by 
      composing them into a single video layer, and then from the video layers, 
      a gallery is formed by layering them on top of each other.
       Then the camera shoots at the top. The hands are controlled to play by leap motion, 
       creating the entire performance mode. By looping the video gallery in the background, 
       it creates a sense of a whirlpool that is always going on. 
       It also reflects the user's state of being lost in the flood of information in 
       the current social media.  </p>

<h2 style="background-color:rgba(251, 50, 50, 0.926);"> About the situated work</h2>
<p><b>The fusion of fragmented social media messages into a layered video gallery 
  reflects a recursive structure reminiscent of nesting dolls or Escher's infinite loops. 
  This dynamic intertwining mirrors the perpetual whirlpool of information inundating 
  today's social media landscape.</b></p>

<p><b>The camera is strategically positioned at the top of this layered video gallery, 
    capturing the entire composition from a unique vantage point. This perspective allows 
    the audience to witness the intricate interplay of the fragmented social media messages 
    as they are woven together. </b></p>

 <p><b>The user's interaction with the Leap Motion controller directly influences the playback 
  of the video gallery, providing immediate feedback. However, the overarching sense of being 
  lost in the flood of information represents a more indirect causal connection, 
  reflecting the complex web of social media influence and consumption.</b></p>

<p><b>The user's hands are controlled using a Leap Motion device, 
  enabling them to interact with and manipulate the visual elements in a performative manner. 
  By physically engaging with the installation, the audience becomes an integral 
  part of the creative process, shaping the outcome through their movements and gestures.</b></p>

<p><b>By looping the video gallery in the background, a mesmerizing sense of a perpetual 
    whirlpool is created. This visual metaphor reflects the user's state of being lost in the 
    flood of information on social media, where the constant stream of content can be 
    overwhelming and disorienting.</b></p>
