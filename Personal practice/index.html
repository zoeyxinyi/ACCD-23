    <p style="color:rgb(203, 188, 125);">In this work I wanted to bring 
      in a visual performance through my personal experience of hiking. 
      What I see when I hike, I take photographs about. What I hear, I recorded. 
      Taking these abstract materials and composing them into a consistent 
      visual performance. </p>

<p style="color:rgb(203, 188, 125);">I sought to translate the sights and sounds 
  encountered along the trails into a tangible expression. Each photograph 
  became a snapshot of a moment in time, preserving the beauty and serenity 
  found in the wilderness. But the visual narrative didn't end there. Equipped 
  with a keen ear for the nuances of nature's symphony, I recorded the melodic 
  chirping of birds, the rustle of leaves in the wind, and the gentle babbling 
  of streams. These auditory gems served as a soundtrack to accompany the visual 
  feast, adding depth and dimension to the sensory experience. </p>

<p style="color:rgb(203, 188, 125);">Yet, it was the harmonious fusion of these 
  abstract materials that truly brought my vision to life. Through meticulous 
  editing and arrangement, I wove together the images and sounds, layering them 
  in a seamless tapestry of sight and sound. The result was a mesmerizing visual 
  performance that transported the audience to the heart of the wilderness, inviting 
  them to embark on a sensory journey unlike any other. </p>

<p style="color:rgb(203, 188, 125);">In essence, my work served as a homage to 
  the transformative power of nature, capturing not just its physical beauty, but 
  also the profound sense of awe and wonder it inspires within us. Through the medium 
  of visual performance, I hoped to evoke that same sense of connection and reverence 
  for the natural world, inviting others to join me on a journey of exploration and 
  discovery. </p>
